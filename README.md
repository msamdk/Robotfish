# Robotfish pose estimation 
![Demo GIF](pose.gif)




This is a fish pose estimation project that is based on the Robotfish pose estimation dataset which is produced by the  Intelligent Biomimetic Design Laboratory (IBDLab) of Peking University.[`https://en.ibdl.pku.edu.cn/`](https://en.ibdl.pku.edu.cn/)
